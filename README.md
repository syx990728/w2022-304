Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is a serious issue all over the world, and therefore the data analysis of COVID-19 cases is important because it gives valuable insights, provides public understanding, develops prevention and aid with planning and so on. This report utilizes data from COVID-19 cases in Toronto to analyze the relation between the number of cases and age group, gender, geographical divisions, source of infection. In the analysis, the 20-29 years age group gets the most COVID-19 cases so young people should realize the severity of COVID-19. More importantly, Scarborough and Rexdale have the most COVID-19 cases because they are low-income neighbourhoods and areas with a higher proportion of essential workers. The underlying logic of society affects the number of COVID-19 cases.
